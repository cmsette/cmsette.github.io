### I am a computational ecologist who specializes in mechanistic modeling and statistics.
I received my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from UC Santa Cruz in Barry Sinervo's lab. My research has primarily focused on developing mechanistic models describing complex ecological systems. [Learn more about me](./about-me.html)

## Projects
### [solveSimplex](https://github.com/cmsette/solveSimplex)
**solveSimplex** is an evolutionary game theory solver in R for single-population games with 2-5 strategies. 

This code solves for all internal and face equilibria and classifies the equilibrium types (source, saddle, sink). Analysis of face games allows for better understanding of equilibrium dynamics in the system and invasion pathways for individual strategies.
