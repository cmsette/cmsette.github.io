## Summary ##
#### I am a computational ecologist who specializes in mechanistic modeling and statistical analysis of complex biological systems and large datasets. I am excited to transition from academic research to Data Science.

I have over 9 years of experience in experimental design, hypothesis testing, and mathematical modeling of various biological systems. I am a flexible researcher with a strong repertoire of data analysis, statistical, and modeling skills. 

My research has involved:

* Using statistical models to understand what environmental variables that contribute to the abundance of a fungal pathogen over time.
* Analyzing evolutionary game theory simulations to describe the mathematical features of stable systems of competitors.
* Utilizing published empirical data to parameterize a game theory model of plastic developmental strategies.
* Developing mechanistic models to predict climate change-driven extinctions.
